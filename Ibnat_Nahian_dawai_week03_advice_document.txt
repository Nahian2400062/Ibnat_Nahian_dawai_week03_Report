My experience with using AI for report writing was more challenging than anticipated. Upon submitting my research question, ChatGPT promptly provided a plan. However, the proposed plan was not as straightforward as initially suggested. Generating specific graphs and tables required repeated clarification and multiple requests for assistance before suitable coding instructions were provided. Ultimately, I had to execute the codes myself, manually producing each visualization. In the end, most of the actual writing was accomplished independently. Although ChatGPT assisted me by condensing my original four-page report down to two pages, the substantial effort in structuring and articulating my findings remained my responsibility.
To my fellow data analysis students, I offer this advice: while ChatGPT can be a useful tool for initial planning and coding assistance, it has notable limitations when it comes to fully composing a comprehensive report. Trust in your own abilities, lean on AI for specific technical tasks, but maintain confidence in your personal insights and writing skills. Your critical thinking and self-reliance will serve you better in creating high-quality reports.
